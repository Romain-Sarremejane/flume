\description{
Get and set discharge and cross-sectional area of a river network
}
\details{
There are three possible models for discharge/cross-sectional area, depending on the
kind of input provided.

If discharge is provided as a vector or a single-column matrix, then discharge will be treated as constant
throughout any simulations. In this case, then length of the input must equal the number of nodes in the
river network.

If discharge is provided as a matrix with ncol > 1, then a variable discharge model will be used. The input in this
case is a hydrograph, where the rows are nodes in the river network and the columns are time steps. Time
steps will be recycled, so if a model is run for a more steps than is present in the discharge matrix, then discharge
will restart at the first columns of the matrix.

The final possibility is to provide a function that takes a single parameter, the time step, as input and returns
a discharge vector with one element per node in the river network.

Cross sectional area can either be missing or provided in the same format as discharge. If missing, then cross
sectional area will be computed using hydrological scaling relationships; see \code{\link[=geometry]{geometry()}} for details.

Note that if cross-sectional area is provided, then the discharge model is changed (e.g., from constant to variable),
it is strongly recommended (and not checked!) that the user ALSO update cross-sectional area to match the new model,
otherwise undefined behavior will occur.

\code{cs_area(x) <- NULL} will delete any provided cross sectional area and revert to the default behavior, computing
area using \code{\link[=geometry]{geometry()}}
