# flume
An r package for a FLUvial Meta Ecosystem Model

## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("flee-group/flume")
```

## Getting started

There are a number of vignettes available to help you get a flume model going. Start with [a simple sumulation](https://flee-group.github.io/flume/simple_sim.html) to see how the model is structured. Then you can get more information on [importing a river network](https://flee-group.github.io/flume/network_import.html) and [designing metacommunities](https://flee-group.github.io/flume/metacommunities.html).
